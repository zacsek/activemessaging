# Introduction #

This page is a parent for examples of Java integration, as well as a wishlist for scenarios or enhancements to integration that people would like to see.  Scenarios are most valuable with some working code.  Best examples should eventually get added to the demo application in the soure code.

# Integration Scenarios #

Integrating with Java Applications:
  * Using Spring JmsTemplate to send/receieve JMS/Stomp messages from Rails via ActiveMQ
  * Synchronous messaging between Rails and Java/Spring using queues and correlation id

# Wish Lists #

Scenarios people would like to see how to:
  * Using YAML as a messaging format between Rails and Java
  * Using JRuby Spring managed beans to communicate with ActiveMessaging

Enhancements to ActiveMessaging for Java integration:
  * JMS Adapter, rather than Stomp, for ActiveMessaging
